# CSS101
___

This was our first CSS assigment, live coded, during the front end track at Nashville Software School. It outlines basic CSS stylings for `section` containers (background colors, borders), adding images to HTML with sizing, and having multiple pages. For exemplary purposes and practice. 

To run code, clone or fork repo. No dependencies required.
